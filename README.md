# Lite_Perl_Win
This is a very lite build of Perl for Windows. All the files are compiled natively on windows by using the MSVC (V142) Compiler



How to use it.

Frist,you need to download it from the releases pages,and you'll have to add it to your $PATH Environment.
open a shell,and enjoy~!

This is a very first build,so there are still many problems.
If you want to install modules by using cpan. You must run the command in a Developer Command Prompt which must have MSVC full environment installed (and you need the Administrator permission on the most times)

However we have already use it to compile some large Projects like Openssl,so if you only want to build and run some Projects on windows,this is a very good choice!
